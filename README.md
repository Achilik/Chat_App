Chat App is a real-time messaging application that allows users to engage in instant communication with each other. We've created this "real-time chat application" with web sockets and socket.io this allowed me to set up an application with real-time by directional communication where the client can send information to the server and the server can send information
to the client over this persistent connection. ðŸ“±ðŸ’»
